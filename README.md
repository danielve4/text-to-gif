# Text To GIF
## Website Description
At 'Text to GIFs' you can enter any piece of text and we'll 
convert the sentiment (positive or negative) and most important words into a GIF. 

We recommend using _at least_ 3 senteces in order to get some acceptable results.

We encourage you to copy and paste content of news articles as they'll contain
words that are most likely to be converted into GIFs.
